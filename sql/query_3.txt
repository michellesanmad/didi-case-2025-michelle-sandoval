-- Query 3: Weekly Growth in Restaurant Visitors
-- Objective: Calculate week-over-week growth in total visitor volume,
--            considering only full weeks with data from all 7 days.
-- Strategy:
--   - Aggregate daily visitors
--   - Filter for complete weeks (7 unique days)
--   - Compute total visitors per week
--   - Calculate week-over-week growth using LAG()
